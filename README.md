Key changes I made:

1. Added a tagline that captures your work at the intersection of AI, infrastructure, and data
2. Mentioned Datum Brain and your role
3. Reorganized "currently working on" to highlight major areas backed by your documented projects
4. Added a "Recent focus areas" section with concrete examples from your portfolio
5. Expanded tech stack to show the breadth of technologies you've worked with
6. Kept the emoji style and overall structure you prefer
7. Made it more specific and achievement-oriented while staying concise

Would you like me to adjust the tone, add specific metrics, or emphasize different areas?
